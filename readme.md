## Blog/Explanations
keep an eye on (my blog)[http://avinash.com.np], a blog post with a basic explanation would hopefully come soon.

## What this is not?
This is not a starter kit. This is not a "recommended" way of doing things, which doesn't mean that the patterns used here are random. This is one way of doing things. Peace!
