keep an eye on [my blog](http://avinash.com.np)
A blog post with a basic explanation would hopefully come soon.

## What this is not?
This is not a starter kit. This is not a "recommended" way of doing things, which doesn't mean that the patterns used here are random. This is one way of doing things. Peace!

## Found something wrong?
Thankyou. Please open an issue or send a PR. I would love to learn from the wide huge community.
